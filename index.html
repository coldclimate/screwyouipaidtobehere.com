          <p>I love films. This is why I have paid to come to the cinema. Sitting in this seat has probably cost me at least &pound; 10 and I don't begrudge a penny of it. Seeing a great film in the cinema, on a huge screen, with an amazing sound system and as part of a group remains one of lifes great pleasures. Please, take my money, I am gladly offering it.</p>

<p>However, being that I've paid to be here, and I am something of a captive audience, please do not take the piss too much. Adverts I can stand, so long as they don't go on for hours. Trailers for upcoming films are fine too, in fact I really enjoy them, but I have a bone to pick with you.</p>

<p>Regardless of the economic impact of piracy on your industry (and I have no doubt it is significant) please do not lecture me on it, let alone in the incriminating and accusatory tones that you do. Films depicting fading cinema populated by grey and dieing people are an insult to all involved.</p>

<h2>Screw you, I've paid to be here</h2>

<p>We, the cinema going public are not your enemy. Neither are all those who buy DVDs and then have to sit through endless unskippable trailers. Spending money on making us feel crappy is ludicrous. Face your real problems, and leave us alone.</p>

<p>Best wishes,<br /> 
A film lover</p>
